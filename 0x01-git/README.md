Task 1: Repo-session
	Create a new directory called 0x01-git in your alx-pre_course repo.

Make sure you include a non empty README.md in your directory:

at the root of your repository alx-pre_course
AND in the directory 0x01-git

Task 2: Coding fury road
		For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a README.md. It’s time to code!

Inside 0x01-git:

Create these directories at the root of your project: bash, c, js
Create these empty files:
c/c_is_fun.c
js/main.js
js/index.js
Create a file bash/alx with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "ALX"
Create a file bash/school with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "School"
Add all these new files to git
Commit your changes (message: “Starting to code today, so cool”) and push to the remote server
