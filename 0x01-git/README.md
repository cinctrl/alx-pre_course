Task 1: Repo-session
	Create a new directory called 0x01-git in your alx-pre_course repo.

Make sure you include a non empty README.md in your directory:

at the root of your repository alx-pre_course
AND in the directory 0x01-git

Task 2: Coding fury road
		For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a README.md. It’s time to code!

Inside 0x01-git:

Create these directories at the root of your project: bash, c, js
Create these empty files:
c/c_is_fun.c
js/main.js
js/index.js
Create a file bash/alx with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "ALX"
Create a file bash/school with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "School"
Add all these new files to git
Commit your changes (message: “Starting to code today, so cool”) and push to the remote server

Task 3:	Collaboration is the base of a company

		For this project, create a branch update_script and in this branch:

Create an empty file named bash/98
Update bash/alx by replacing echo "ALX" with echo "ALX School"
Update bash/school by replacing echo "School" with echo "The school is open!"
Add and commit these changes (message: “My personal work”)
Push this new branch Tips
Perfect! You did an amazing update in your project and it’s isolated correctly from the main branch.

Ho wait, your manager needs a quick fix in your project and it needs to be deployed now:

Change branch to main
Update the file bash/alx by replacing echo "ALX" with echo "ALX School is so cool!"
Delete the directory js
Commit your changes (message: “Hot fix”) and push to the origin

Task 4: Collaboration: be up to date

		For this task – and only for this task – please update your file README.md in the main branch from GitHub.com. It’s the only time you are allowed to update and commit from GitHub interface.

After you have done that, in your terminal:

Get all changes of the main branch locally (i.e. your README.md file will be updated)
Create a new file up_to_date at the root of your directory and in it, write the git command line used
Add up_to_date to git, commit (message: “How to be up to date in git”), and push to the origin
